Hi, not sure if I do this the right way. I only want to share an idea for Powertoys: can you add an option to show the remaining battery life in real numbers in the system tray? So you can directly see how much is left in stead of having to click on the battery icon in the system tray.
Sorry if this is not the right way to share this input.
Keep up the good work, I like Powertoys.
